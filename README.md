# Wk10-11-Honeypot

## Overview
The purpose is to stand up a basic honeypot and demonstrate its effectiveness at detecting and/or collecting data about an attack. Our goal is to demonstate these basic priciples:
- Successful configuration and deployment of a network-accessible honeypot server with two primary features:
  - An attack surface that is vulnerable or exposed in some way to network-based attacks
  - A network security feature such as an IDS configured to detect and log such attacks
- Illustration of at least one attack against the honeypot that can be detected or logged in a way that captures information about the attack or the attacker
